## Topics Covered

### Assignment 7: Basic Probability
- Addition rule: P(AâˆªB) = P(A) + P(B) - P(Aâˆ©B)
- Complement rule: P(A') = 1 - P(A)
- Venn diagrams and set operations
- Union, intersection, complement concepts

### Assignment 8: Conditional Probability
- Conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(Aâˆ©B)/P(B)
- Multiplication rule: P(Aâˆ©B) = P(A) Ã— P(B|A)
- Independence testing: P(A) Ã— P(B) = P(Aâˆ©B)
- Two-way tables and joint probabilities

### Assignment 9: Binomial Distribution
- Binomial probability: P(X=k) = C(n,k) Ã— p^k Ã— (1-p)^(n-k)
- Expected value: E(X) = n Ã— p
- Standard deviation: SD(X) = âˆš[nÃ—pÃ—(1-p)]
- TI-84 binompdf() and binomcdf() functions

### Assignment 10: Normal Distribution
- Z-score calculations: z = (x - Î¼)/Ïƒ
- Empirical rule: 68-95-99.7
- Normal distribution properties
- TI-84 normalcdf() function

### Assignment 11: Sampling Distributions
- Central Limit Theorem applications
- Standard error: Ïƒ/âˆšn
- Sample proportion distributions
- CLT conditions (n â‰¥ 30)
